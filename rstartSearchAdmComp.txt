Add-PsSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication "Search Service Application"
$admin = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchAdministrationComponent -SearchApplication $ssa
$admin | Set-SPEnterpriseSearchAdministrationComponent -SearchServiceInstance "server" -Force

Couple of things to check.

Solution # 1 simply change the application pool to use SharePoint Web Services System for search service applications and check.

Go IIS
In IIS > Expand server > Expand sites > Expand “SharePoint Web Services
Now check all the GUID 1 by 1 in content view unless you find searchadmin.svc and searchservice.svc
Right click GUID go to advance settings
Change the application to “SharePoint Web Services” > Click OK
Solution # 2Enable the timer job and do IIS reset:

Run below PS command to enable the service.

Enable-SPTimerJob job-application-server-admin-service

Result ==> IsDisabled: False
Do Net Stop sptimerv4
Do Net start sptimerv4
Do iisreset
Solution 3

Ensure the account has full control permissions on the Search service application and IIS account used by this service application

Open Central Admin > Select Security > Select “Configure service accounts”
Select the search service application
For “select account for this component” Select a account which has full permission
SharePoint Server: "The search service is not able to connect to the machine that hosts the administration component"

Checked all these settings, but no luck. I had deleted the previous search service application which was stuck in 'paused for:external request' state and re-created this new search service application through Configuration wizard in SharePoint Foundation 2013 and this is causing above problem. – Amol Kadam Feb 12 '16 at 9:55

You should run the psconfiguration wizard once and that should definitely solve your problem.

What solved it for me: moving the SearchAdministrationComponent back and forth

Add-PsSnapin Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
cls


$ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication "Search Service Application"
$admin = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchAdministrationComponent -SearchApplication $ssa
$admin | Set-SPEnterpriseSearchAdministrationComponent -SearchServiceInstance SERVERNAME -Force
